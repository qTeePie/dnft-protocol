# DNFT Protocol

‚ùóÔ∏è **This is a dev playground, not an NFT project üôà**
This repo is a personal Solidity + blockchain practice project.

I‚Äôm a junior developer learning to build decentralized protocols.  
**DNFT is my sandbox for testing on-chain SVG NFTs, ERC721 logic, and permission-based marketplace approval.**  
The goal of this project is to use it as a foundation for my future NFT marketplace protocol.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs here

- Dynamic on-chain SVG NFT logic
- ERC721 `approveMarketplace()` experiments
- On-chain metadata encoding (Base64)
- Testing NFT approvals and permissions

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Disclaimer

**This is NOT an art drop, commercial project, or production-ready contract.**  
It‚Äôs a learning project built as part of my blockchain dev journey.  
Use at your own risk.
